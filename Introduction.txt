This guide contains the way of usage of the library OpenCV, which is used for computer visioning, on Python.

Recommended path of this learning program is "C:\". You may move the file "OpenCV Guide" to that location.

You may need to run the following commands on terminal to installation of necessary libraries:
    For installing by PIP you need to have python on your computer.
        If you do not, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    pip install opencv-python
        If that does not work, try this: pip3 install opencv-python
    pip install imutils
        If that does not work, try this: pip3 install imutils

The order of learning path is:
    1. Displaying Image
